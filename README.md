# Virtual-Assistant-Mini
Virtual assistants are software programs that help you ease your day-to-day tasks, such as showing weather reports, creating remainders, making shopping lists, etc. They can take commands via text (online chatbots) or by voice. Voice-based intelligent assistants need an invoking word or wake word to activate the listener, followed by the command. We have so many virtual assistants, such as Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, and Microsoft’s Cortana.
